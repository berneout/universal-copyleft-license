# Universal Share Alike License

a license that allow free use, but requires sharing all kinds of new work alike

This license is a [flipped form](https://flippedform.com) in everyday English.  If something doesn't make sense, that's the license's fault, not yours.  Please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/berneout/universal-share-alike-license/issues/new) so we can fix it.
